## UX

## Strategy 
I used an Agile methodology when planning the planning the project, with the use of projects and issues. I used issues to create the user stories for this project which served as a guidelines for building the project.

CRUD functionality is very important when it comes to this webbapp as user interaction is everything. The user is able to create a booking, the webapp will then display all the bookings the user has made, the user will then have the options to either update their bookings or delete any booking they have. With the help of validation being implemented in the webapp, users are unble to make two identical reservations.
