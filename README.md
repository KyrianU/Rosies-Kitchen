# Rosie's Kitchen

## Introdution

## UX

## Strategy 
I used an Agile methodology when planning the planning the project, with the use of projects and issues. I used issues to create the user stories for this project which served as a guidelines for building the project.

CRUD functionality is very important when it comes to this webbapp as user interaction is everything. The user is able to create a booking, the webapp will then display all the bookings the user has made, the user will then have the options to either update their bookings or delete any booking they have. With the help of validation being implemented in the webapp, users are unble to make two identical reservations. 

## User Stories

1. As a user, I am able to navigate through the site and view desired content
2. As a user I can get key information about the restaurant from the landing page
3. As an admin user I am able to login so I can access the site's backend
4. As the site owner, I can display restaurant menu so that the customer knows whats on offer
5. As a user, I want to be able to fill a booking form in order make reservation
6. As user, I want to be able to register in order to log in
7. As a user, I want to be able to make changes to my booking when necessary
8. As a user, I would like to know the opening time in order to make a reservation accordingly
9. As a user, I would like to be able to see all my reservation
10. As a user, I would like to delete the booking if It's no longer convenient
