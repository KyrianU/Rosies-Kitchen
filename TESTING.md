# Bugs 

## Fixed Bugs
- Users were unable to edit or delete their reservation, this was due to a typing error in the reservation view.
- Users were able to view and make amendments for other users reservations

## Unfixed Bugs
- Date Picker not working as it should, which means user has to input their reservation request format as
YYYY/MM/DD
- Seats option allows you to pick an infinite number, but only allows you to pick 1-4 seats
